**"An Industry Guide to Becoming a software Engineer"** by Bill Langerberg.

  During my reading, the Guide  made me  understand  what to focus on, the 
skills needed to be  know and how data structures works and how to solve it by
debugging it.
I definetely need to know the essentials troubleshooting skills.
Bill's also back his arguments with examples and many other steps. For me 
he has such a great dicdatic startegy of teaching people what they need 
to know to kick-off their Software Engineering Career. How to write code and how
to review code are important value of a Software Engineer.

According to me, I always want to know  and understand how  language are put
together and during execution they can explain perfect thought of a developer
 or become an application.
From my knowledge becoming a developer or Software engineer should be  someone
who love language and can be able to interpret those languange also
being able to solve any computer issue, software like hardware.You need to
know the best languange and right tool to commentyour peers and your own work.

In conclusion this is a great document that i could recommend to anyone. It has
the correct points and words. Especially what needed to be successful in the 
career. The best way to learn  is to *keep practicing* this tools and languages
and reviewing friends work on Github, stackoverflow.

It is all you need to be a good candidate at any job interview and job search.


Thanks
